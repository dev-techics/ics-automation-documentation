# Installation

This guide will help you get the **frontend application** running locally.
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-techics/ics-automation.git
```

Navigate to the frontend folder

```bash
cd ics-automation/frontend
```

Install dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js installed (v18+ recommended).

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

> The application should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).

```bash
npm run build
```

Build for production . This will generate a production-ready build in the `dist/` folder.

:::tip Tips

If you’re using VS Code, you can open the folder and install recommended extensions for React, TypeScript, and Tailwind to improve development experience.
