# Lists & Segments

**Lists & Segments** is where you organize and manage all of your contacts in ICS Legal Automate. Whether you're building a simple static list for a one-off campaign or creating smart dynamic segments for targeted automations, everything happens here.

You can store unlimited contacts and keep them neatly organized so that the right message always reaches the right person at the right time.

### What’s the difference?

| Term        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **List**    | A static collection of contacts you manually add or import. Contacts stay in the list until you remove them.                                                                                                           |
| **Segment** | A dynamic group of contacts based on rules and conditions (e.g., country = “India”, tag = “Tier 1 Visa”, last engaged > 30 days ago). Segments update automatically when contacts meet or no longer meet the criteria. |
