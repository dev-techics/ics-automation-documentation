# Template Builder

The **Template Builder** is a powerful, drag-and-drop email editor. It allows you (or your team) to create beautiful, professional, and fully responsive email templates without writing a single line of code.

With the Template Builder, you can quickly build:

- Welcome emails
- Consultation confirmation emails
- Visa application status updates
- Newsletter campaigns
- Service promotion emails

### Key Features

- **Drag & Drop Interface** – Simply drag content blocks (text, images, buttons, dividers, social icons, etc.) into your template.
- **Pre-designed Blocks** – Choose from a growing library of ready-made blocks tailored for immigration services (e.g., “Book a Consultation” CTA, service comparison tables, testimonial sections).
- **Fully Responsive** – Every template automatically looks perfect on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Brand Customization** – Easily apply your firm’s colors, fonts, logo, and footer details across all templates.
- **Image Hosting** – Upload and manage images directly in the editor.
- **HTML Block** – Advanced users can add custom HTML/CSS for complete design flexibility.
- **Real-time Preview** – See exactly how your template will appear to recipients before saving.
- **Save as Reusable Template** – Once you create a great design, save it as a template and reuse it across multiple campaigns or automations.
